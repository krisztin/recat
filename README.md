**Let's try and build a Tinder inspired SPA with React!**

The idea might sound a tad scandalous but there are only good intentions behind it I assure you. If you don't care for all the _fluff_ just skip to the next paragraph. Still with me? Right. I used to work for an animal home admining their website and one of the most needed UX features were filters. Other than the picture and name of a cat or dog you got no other information unless you've clicked to see their profile at which point you had to realise they will definitely not get on well with your current overlord or best friend. Fun! But hey, at least it was great for creating long sessions and lots of clicks and those were the things the Head of Marketing and Communications were interested in. Me, I wanted to make our visitorsâ€™ lives a bit easier. This little app idea is a culmination of all the UX stuff on my wishlist spiced up with a little fun element. Funnily enough, the MVP does not have any filters...priorities.

[Prototype](https://codepen.io/krisztiiin/pen/zLePMb) of sorts...Only I am making a primarily desktop app. Why you ask? Well, I have not the first clue about React Native. To be fair, I don't have much clue about React either and yet this is a React app. So...stay tuned?

# Progress

## Day 1-2

I drew up the complete project with required components and functionalities needed. The optimist in me said just go for it. The realist decided to draw up an MVP version with a couple of components taken out and some functions dumbed down or excluded.

Looked like it was quite doable in a few days. Until...

### Routing

I thought I got React Router...turns out, not so much.

#### The problem

From the opening page you should be taken to a random cat when clicking 'Start'. I got a little perplexed. Nothing I've tried with `<Route to>` etc. worked, and I kept breaking the `<Link>`. To be fair, it was very late at night and my brain was having one of those 'toddler tantrum' times when it refuses to put in any effort until I treat it with a little YouTube, but that was not going to happen.

Now, on Day 2, with fresh eyes I have an inkling the answer lies with `history.push`

#### The solution?

[Read the Docs](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/web/example/basic) and learn the ins and outs of React Router. Or at least find the exact solution I need.

#### The solution!

```js
getCat = () => {
  const cats = { ...this.state.cats };
  const firstCat = cats[0].name.toLowerCase();
  this.props.history.push(`/cats/${firstCat}`);
};
```

_I did not really read any of the docs in the end_ :grimacing:

### End of Day 2

**It's DONE**.

Well, the MVP at least. I'll probably spend the next day hooking up the repo with Netlify and learning how to automate the process. Then it's time to iron out some kinks and start adding more features.

But I'm calling it quits for today. It's Saturday, I didn't have much time to fiddle with this but my brain is already protesting (I've just spent 30 minutes debugging a simple `if` statement).
